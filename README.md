# Assignment 19

For this assignment you will run a dice simulation where you let the user pick the number of rolls.

## Specifications

* You need to have at least two classes (e.g. `Runner` and `Simulation` or `Runner`, `Die`, and `Simulation`).

* The user should be able to specify how many rolls (Hint: `for` loop).

* It should output how many times each value was rolled.

* Your program should not allow inputs smaller than 0 and the user should be able to run the program as many times as they want. Use `while` loops to achieve this functionality.

### Sample Outputs
```
How many rolls? 10

1: 3 (30%)
2: 4 (40%)
3: 3 (30%)
```

```
How many rolls? 50

1: 12 (24%)
2: 20 (40%)
3: 18 (36%)
```

### Grading

As always, your program will be graded on its functionality according to the project specifications and proper code style.

### Challenge

* Use multiple dice.

* Let the user choose the number of sides for the di(c)e.
